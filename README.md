Project Name: Assessment Recommendation Engine – Personalized Assessment Suggestions
________________________________________
Problem Statement:
Students often struggle to find relevant assessments or tests that match their goals. This tool recommends the most suitable assessments based on user input, making selection faster and personalized.
________________________________________
Objectives:
•	Match users with suitable assessments based on their goals.
•	Process over 1,000 assessment listings efficiently.
•	Provide recommendations quickly via a responsive interface.
•	Maintain a modular and scalable architecture for easy updates.
________________________________________
Input & Output:
•	Input: A user-defined goal or skill (text query).
•	Output: A ranked list of recommended assessments based on similarity.
________________________________________
Technologies Used:
•	Python for overall development.
•	NLP Techniques: TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) for text representation.
•	Similarity Measure: Cosine Similarity to compare user query and assessment content.
•	FastAPI for backend API development.
•	Streamlit for building an interactive front-end.
•	Modular Design: Clear separation between feature generation, similarity logic, API, and UI.
________________________________________
System Architecture Workflow:
1.	User inputs their goal via the Streamlit UI.
2.	FastAPI backend receives the request.
3.	TF-IDF processes both the user input and assessment descriptions into numerical vectors.
4.	Cosine Similarity computes similarity scores.
5.	The system returns the top assessment recommendations, displayed in the UI.
________________________________________
Modeling & Design Reasoning:
•	TF-IDF was chosen because it effectively highlights keywords relevant to each assessment.
•	Cosine Similarity was used for its efficiency in measuring text similarity in high-dimensional vector space.
•	FastAPI + Streamlit combination was chosen to provide both a developer-friendly backend and an intuitive UI.
________________________________________
Performance & Scalability:
•	Precomputed TF-IDF matrix for assessment listings ensures fast similarity computation at runtime.
•	Modular design allows easy updates to the model or assessment list without massive code changes.
•	Lightweight layout enables near real-time recommendations (<1 second per query).
________________________________________
Results:
•	Engine successfully handles over 150 user interactions in testing.
•	Users receive recommendations within 1 second of submitting a query.
•	High user satisfaction (based on user tests) for recommendation relevance.
________________________________________
Deployment & Run Instructions:
1.	Clone the repository.
2.	Set up your Python environment (e.g., pip install -r requirements.txt).
3.	Run the API server using uvicorn main:app --reload.
4.	Launch the frontend via streamlit run frontend.py.
5.	Enter your goal in the UI to get matching assessments instantly.
Future Improvements:
•	Add a feedback loop to learn from accepted vs rejected recommendations.
•	Integrate embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec or Sentence-BERT) for better semantic matching.
•	Containerize the application for robust deployment.
•	Add logging & analytics to monitor usage patterns.
